# Information Center

Welcome to the information center!

Here, I'll compile some information that doesn't fit into the regular docs/tutorials, but I still feel is valuable information.

This includes things like:
- Differences between firmwares
- Small FAQs for some typical issues
- Any other resources I feel are useful to a developer using the Flipper.

This will be a growing compendium of things of that nature, but for more off-beat posts, I will probably be using my [blog](/blog/).
