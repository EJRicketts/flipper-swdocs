# Initial Setup

The typical choice for firmware is the [official firmware](https://www.github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware). For simplicity and consistency, this website will be using it. However, there are other very popular [unofficial distributions](/info-center/firmware/firmware-differences), and the steps will work the same for any distribution.

 Other firmware forks will operate the same way for setup, so you can use whichever fork you want.


# Cloning your first repository

1. Ensure that your machine has access to `git`.
2. Navigate into the directory you would like to store your local copy
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
        git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
   ```

**Voila! You now have the firmware source on your computer.**
